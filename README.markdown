## react-native-login

[Blog post about integrating Facebook SDK with react-native here](http://brentvatne.ca/facebook-login-with-react-native/).

**Deprecation warning**: This is still a useful example to learn how to write native modules and create a login screen, but you should be using [react-native-fbsdk](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-fbsdk) now for a more robust solution to Facebook login.

*Note*: To get this project running, you need to install the [Facebook SDK for iOS](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios)! 

*Warning*: This project is running on React Native 0.5.0, which is a couple of months old. Pull requests welcome to update to the most recent version!

Check out the example gif below (sorry it's a bit heavy) to see it in action. Note that it is in the simulator so it uses the browser for Facebook auth; it will use the Facebook app if it is available. Video background is implemented with [react-native-video](https://github.com/brentvatne/react-native-video), the gradient for the button with [react-native-linear-gradient](https://github.com/brentvatne/react-native-linear-gradient), and the 'About this project' modal with [react-native-modal](https://github.com/brentvatne/react-native-modal).
