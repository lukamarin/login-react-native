Remaining:
- Clean up and integrate into a PR
- Support require('video!...')
  - Extensions other than mp4? image!... does not take an extension
- Add option for repeat - none or forever
- Look at reference for additional properties that can be tweaked

Complete:
x Accept a source option on the Video tag
x Add similar resizeMode options as exist for Images, where possible
